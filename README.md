## 🚀 The Vision: Bridge, Not a Wall

**PrestoWorld (PW)** is built for the pragmatists. We believe you shouldn't have to choose between cutting-edge performance and the world's largest plugin ecosystem.

By re-implementing the CMS core on the **Witals Framework**, we’ve created a "Hybrid Engine" that offers a friction-less migration path for millions of users tired of legacy bloat but dependent on their existing workflows.

## ✨ Why PrestoWorld?

### 🌀 1. Industrial-Grade Foundation

Built on **Witals Framework (PHP 8.1+)** and powered by **RoadRunner (Golang)**.

* **Stateful Performance:** Workers stay live in RAM for sub-30ms response times.
* **Enterprise Ready:** Modern DI, PSR-compliance, and high-concurrency handling.

### 🎨 2. The Best of Visual Design

We’ve refactored the iconic **Elementor 2** into a native **Full Site Editing (FSE)** engine.

* **Drag-and-Drop Everything:** Headers, Footers, and Archives.
* **Clean Code:** No more "div-soup"—just semantic, lightning-fast HTML.

### 👹 3. The Monster Feature: Marketplace Bridge

We don't force you to quit WordPress; we help you evolve out of it.

* **WP.org Compatibility:** A dedicated bridge allows you to enable and install plugins directly from the **WordPress.org Marketplace**.
* **The "Soft" Migration:** Move your site to PrestoWorld today, keep your essential plugins, and enjoy an immediate speed boost thanks to our RoadRunner runtime.
* **Legacy Sandboxing:** Legacy plugins run in an isolated layer to ensure they don't compromise the stability of the Witals core.
